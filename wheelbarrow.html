<h2>When to get Wheelbarrow</h2>

<p class="centerjustify">So I've been asked a number of times about why these builds involve getting wheelbarrow 'too early'. By which they mean, it is earlier than Spirit of the Law told them they should get it. His reasoning goes something like this:<br>The cost of wheelbarrow is roughly equivalent to 3 villagers, and takes the same time to research as well. Therefore wheelbarrow should be researched when it is better than having 3 extra villagers. Wheelbarrow mostly affects farmers, so if we just take into account the number of farms, wheelbarrow should be researched around 22 farms - because 22 farms with wheelbarrow is about as good as 25 farms without. (He then goes on to give a figure for total villager count based on estimated villager distribution, but this is something that will vary between different strategies so people usually just focus on the number of farms when it comes to wheelbarrow.)<br>The problem with this reasoning is it doesn't take into account the additional upfront cost of the farms needed when adding villagers to food. The main reason to get it earlier is that it increases your food income without needing to also invest wood into farms, so you can get up to Castle age making fewer farms. This is especially nice when going archers, as you usually want to move some farmers to wood after you click up anytway.<br>The later farms you make in Feudal are also going to be the furthest from your town center and mill. If on the other hand you would usually build a second mill in Feudal, wheelbarrow means you shouldn't need it. In fact, wheelbarrow has a greater impact on farmers further from your drop-off buildings. On a separate note, faster villagers are more likely to survive raids.</p>
